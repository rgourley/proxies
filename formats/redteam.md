# Format: redteam

Each proxy tries to break the artifact from their seat. There is no consensus step.

## One round, in parallel
Each proxy writes up to five breakages. Each breakage has:
- **Where**: the step, node, or screen.
- **How it breaks**: a concrete scenario with a specific client or attacker.
- **Severity**: critical, high, medium, low, judged from their seat.
- **Fix**: the smallest change that closes it.

If the run has a scenario, every breakage must relate to it.

Aim for about 80 words per breakage. Put your strongest breakage first.

## Synthesis
The facilitator merges duplicates and keeps attribution for each one. It ranks the breakages by severity, then by how many seats found them. It lists every breakage. It does not drop the low-severity ones.

## Verdict
Every response starts with one line after the title: `**Verdict**: <Block | Rework | Ship with changes | Ship>. <one sentence on why>.` Block means you would stop it from your seat. Rework means it must change before you would use or approve it.

## Language
Plain business English. Name each step by what it does, in words. Never use diagram node letters or IDs. Explain acronyms the first time.
